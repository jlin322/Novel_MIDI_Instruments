# Novel_MIDI_Instruments

## Overview
ECD 423 Novel MIDI Instruments is a Senior Capstone Project from 2023-2024. The purpose of this project was to design a creative Novel MIDI Instrument capable of polyphony, pitch bend and variable volume control. The product would utilize the functions of a synthesizer. This project is using the open-source synthesizer, Element. The general design consists of a detachable L-shaped rail which can fit on any ordinary tripod boom mic stand. The product consists of 2 keypads and a base station. The base station contains a tilt detection system and is fixed to the center of the rod. Depending on the location of the keypad on the rail, both keypadsâ€™ orientation as well as angle of rod tilt, the MIDI device is able to switch between different instruments. The 2 keypads are able to freely slide up and down the rod and act as the inputs for the user to control the available instruments on the mic stand. The entire system consists of 3 microcontrollers and 3 nRF24L01 transceiver modules. The transceiver modules create a long signal transmission line which works to send MIDI signals from the moment the user presses on a key or input device to the moment a note is emitted from the synthesizer.
